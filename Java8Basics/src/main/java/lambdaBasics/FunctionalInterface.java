 * For a interface to be of TYPE lambda expression it must have 1 abstract method, it could have any number of default
 * interfaces, but ONLY 1 abstract method is must. This is called funtional Interface, 
 * this type of interfaceis used for Lambda exp
 * 
 * So @FunctionalInterface annotation is used with such interfaces so that by mistake no other abstract method is ever added to the 
 * specific interface
 * 
 *  Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract method.
